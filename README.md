Football simulator
In our football simulator players can choose their teams to manage and admins can make new leagues, teams and footballers.
As player you can manage your team: edit line-up; make transfers; play matches.
You can choose the formation you would like to use and can select the starting players.
You can list any of your players for sale and buy players listed by other users.
The matches have realistical simulation and adequate results(most of the times).
When the match start you can make substitutes every 15 minutes.
When the match ends it will change the current standings and team's budget.
The football players have stats which will impact on their transfer sum and match performance. 
The league has game weeks and the game week has matches. 
Every team will play 1 home and 1 away match with every other team as the matches are ordered realisticly.
